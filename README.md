Some of the tools i'm using in day-to-day development - Residing in ~/bin, along with some installations, as follows:

# Tools

* q - See https://github.com/harelba/q
* secs2date - Converts timestamps to human date-time strings
* sigma - Sums up all the numbers from stdin
* xvsy - Draws a graph of x values vs y values - Getting pairs of x,y lines from standard input
* display - Uses disper in order to control multiple monitor setups for the same machine (docked, undocked,home etc.)
* disable-company-settings/enable-company-settings - Allow quick switching between a company provided maven settings.xml and a default one
* svn-diff-meld - Wrapper so svn would work with meld
